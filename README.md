The CIFAR-10 Prediction (https://image-recognition-app.streamlit.app/)[App] is a simple machine learning application designed to classify images into one of 10 categories: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck.Users can upload an image through the app, which preprocesses it and uses a trained ResNet18 model to predict the class of the image. The app showcases how deep learning models can accurately analyze and recognize visual patterns from datasets like CIFAR-10, demonstrating the practical use of image classification in various applications.
